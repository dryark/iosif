The links given are to clarify which entities exactly are meant. Should
those links become invalid see the online list to find the latest updated
website for the company/group.

The online list may be updated at any time. If a company is added, causing
a party to become a RESTRICTED ENTITY, then that party remains free to use
versions of THE CONTENT created prior to becoming a RESTRICTED ENTITY under
the license terms previous to the change. If this is a concern, it is suggested
that LICENSEE fork THE CONTENT and opt to make use of the option to remove
the online list described below in condition point 6.

Changes made to THE CONTENT of any sort after the date of addition will be
forbidden from use in that case, and those new changes are only licensed under
the new license terms with the updated DIRECT RESTRICTED ENTITY list.

A RESTRICTED ENTITY is defined to be any of the following:
1. A DIRECT RESTRICTED ENTITY
2. An owner of a RESTRICTED ENTITY
3. A subsidiary or any functional business unit of a RESTRICTED ENTITY
4. Any entity of which 50% or more of its annual revenue comes from work done
for a RESTRICTED ENTITY
5. An entity that broke off from a RESTRICTED ENTITY ( such as a company
splitting up into different legal entities )
6. An international counterpart of a RESTRICTED ENTITY.
7. An employee of a RESTRICTED ENTITY
8. A contractor delivering work to a RESTRICTED ENTITY at more than 20hrs per week.

A PARTIALLY RESTRICTED ENTITY is defined to be any of the following:
1. A contractor delivering work to a RESTRICTED ENTITY at less than 20hrs per week.
2. A person or legal entity acting under command, request, or legal contract
by/with a RESTRICTED ENTITY.

Should a PARTIALLY RESTRICTED ENTITY fall under any of the points defining them
as A RESTRICTED ENTITY, they are not a PARTIALLY RESTRICTED ENTITY. 

A PARTIALLY RESTRICTED ENTITY shall be considered a RESTRICTED ENTITY to the extent
that their usage of THE CONTENT is related to commands, requests, or legal contract
with a RESTRICTED ENTITY. That is, A PARTIALLY RESTRICTED ENTITY cannot utilize
THE CONTENT in any way in relation to a RESTRICTED ENTITY.

A PARTIALLY RESTRICTED ENTITY remains able to be a LICENSEE of the content, to the
extent that all usage and access to THE CONTENT remains within the license terms.
That is, a PARTIALLY RESTRICTED ENTITY may utilize THE CONTENT in work related to
other LICENSEE. They remain bound by THE RESTRICTION, prevented from enabling use
of THE CONTENT by any RESTRICTED ENTITY.

LICENSEE refers to any party ( person or legal entity ) who/that is not a
RESTRICTED ENTITY and accepts this license by making use of THE CONTENT or
utilizing any of the permissions provided by the license.

THE CONTENT refers to the content in full, any portion of it, and anything
derived from it.

LICENSEE agrees not to provide THE CONTENT to any RESTRICTED ENTITY, nor to
allow THE CONTENT to be used in any way by any RESTRICTED ENTITY.

THE RESTRICTION is defined to be this license in full, specifically to
refer to the way the license restricts use of THE CONTENT in any way by
any RESTRICTED ENTITY.

THE RESTRICTION shall apply to all projects with Copyright
ownership by any RESTRICTED ENTITY. This shall remain true even if the
project contributions themselves are done by a LICENSEE. LICENSEE
are forbidden from contributing THE CONTENT to a project Copyrighted by
any RESTRICTED ENTITY.

Should any portion of this license be found to be unenforceable, the remaining
portion of the license shall continue to be in effect, preserving the intent.
The intent is to prevent any DIRECT RESTRICTED ENTITY from benefiting from
THE CONTENT in any way.

Should it be found or enacted into law that using such a restriction list is
illegal as a whole, then the entire license shall dissolve and zero permissions
given to anyone by the broken license.

=======================================================================

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to LICENSEE, to conditionally
use, modify, publish, distribute, or sell copies of THE CONTENT.

These permissions are granted with the following conditions:

1. THE CONTENT may not be distributed or sold to any RESTRICTED ENTITY.

2. Access to a service containing or utilizing THE CONTENT may not be
given, sold, or licensed to any RESTRICTED ENTITY. 

3. Any service containing or utilizing THE CONTENT shall be considered a
derivative of this license and therefore by bound by THE RESTRICTION.
This includes use of THE CONTENT by way of dynamic libraries, indirect calls,
scripting, virtualization, containerization, or instantiation as a remote
callable service. Such restricted software must be prevented from being
used by any RESTRICTED ENTITY.

4. THE CONTENT cannot be sold to any RESTRICTED ENTITY.

5. THE CONTENT may not be published to or distributed through a system
owned or controlled by any RESTRICTED ENTITY.

6. Any derivatives of THE CONTENT must be licensed under this same license.
By same license this means the contents of this LICENSE file in its
entirety. The license "duplicate" may have the online restricted list removed,
effectively fixing the DIRECT RESTRICTED ENTITY from that point onward for
that derivative. At the moment in time of that removal, the online list must
be checked, and any new DIRECT RESTRICTED ENTITY present in the online list
added to the new updated fixed list in the license file. Besides that single
permitted modification, the LICENSE may not be modified in any other way.

7. Any derivatives of THE CONTENT must be publicly released within 2 months
of the change or discarded.

8. The above copyright notice and this LICENSE file must be included in
all copies and derivative forms of THE CONTENT.

9. LICENSEE understands and agrees that this content is provided "as is",
without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited
to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable
for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with THE CONTENT or
the use or other dealings of it.
